   Tennessee. Schwab went to an all-girls 
   Southern preparatory school. She 
   graduated from Washington University 
   in St. Louis with a Bachelor of Fine 
   Arts in 2009. She had originally planned 
   to study Astrophysics, but changed 
   directions after taking art and literature 
   courses. She completed her first novel 
   (unpublished) in her sophomore year, 
   and sold her debut novel, The Near Witch, 
   to Disney before graduating.

 She is known for the 2013 novel Vicious,
  the Shades of Magic series, and The Invisible

  the 2020 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.
  She publishes children's and young adult 
  fiction books published under the name Victoria

    Her work has received critical acclaim, 
    translated into over two dozen languages, 
    and optioned for television and film. First
    Kill – a YA vampire series based on Schwab’
    s short story of the same name – is

    of a coffee shop, dreaming up monsters.
