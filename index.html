    <h1>
      Early Life and Education
    </h1>
    <p>
      Victoria Elizabeth (V. E.) Schwab is an American
      writer.
      Schwab was born on July 7, 1987, in
      California and grew up in Nashville,
      Tennessee. Schwab went to an all-girls
      Southern preparatory school. She
      graduated from Washington University
      in St. Louis with a Bachelor of Fine
      Arts in 2009. She had originally planned
      to study Astrophysics, but changed
      directions after taking art and literature
      courses. She completed her first novel
      in her sophomore year,
      and sold her debut novel, The Near Witch,
      to Disney before graduating.
    </p>
 <h1>
      Career
    </h1>
    <p>
      She is known for the 2013 novel Vicious,
      the Shades of Magic series, and The Invisible
      Life of Addie LaRue, which was nominated for
      the 2020 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.
      She publishes children's and young adult
      fiction books published under the name Victoria
      Schwab. She is the creator of the
      supernatural teen drama series First Kill,
      based on her short story of the same name
      originally published in the 2020 anthology
      Vampires Never Get Old: Tales With Fresh Bite.
      Her work has received critical acclaim,
      translated into over two dozen languages,
      and optioned for television and film. </p>
    <p>
      The Guardian called Vicious "a brilliant exploration of the
      superhero mythos, and a riveting revenge thriller".
      Additionally, it received a starred review from Publishers
      Weekly, which also named the novel one of its best books of 
      2013 for Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror. The American Library 
      Association's Reference and User Services Association likewise 
      awarded it the top fantasy book in their 2014 Reading List. 
      In late 2013, the rights for a film adaptation of Vicious were 
      bought jointly by Story Mining & Supply Co and Ridley Scott's 
      Scott Free Productions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2014, Schwab signed a two-book deal with Tor Books,
      which included A Darker Shade of Magic and its sequel. 
      The former was published in February 2015, and also 
      received a starred review from Publishers Weekly.
      In 2017, she signed another book deal with Tor for 
      Vengeful, the sequel to Vicious; a new trilogy set 
      called Threads of Power, which takes place in the 
      same world as the Shades of Magic series; and an "homage
      to Blade Runner" called Black Tabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 2018, Schwab gave the sixth annual Tolkien Lecture 
      at Pembroke College, Oxford.

      In 2020, Schwab joined the panel of Podcast Writing 
      excuses to discuss book themes and other topics.

      The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue was published by Tor 
      Books on October 6, 2020. It was heavily praised and
      nominated for the 2020 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Schwab's short story "First Kill" was published in the 2020 
      anthology Vampires Never Get Old: Tales With Fresh Bite. On 
      October 15, 2020, Netflix gave a series order to the 
      production First Kill (TV series). Schwab served 
      at the creator and an executive producer of the series 
      and as a writer for a number of episodes. The first 
      season of the series premiered on June 10, 2022, on Netflix.
